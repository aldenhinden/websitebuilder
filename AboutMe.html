            <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
            <p class="text center" style="text-align: left;">
                Born in The Bronx, NYC, I grew up on Vashon, a small island in the Pacific Northwest 
                between the cities of Seattle and Tacoma. I spent my childhood in wilderness programs, 
                my passion for the outdoors remaining indissoluble throughout my life. I love hiking, 
                surfing, snowboarding, and all the adventures that are found in their persuit. 
                My favorite sport is soccer, and my favorite player is Lionel Messi.

                I have always had a passion for music, playing piano for many years as a child and more 
                recently picking up the guitar. My love blues and rock the most, with my favorite musicians 
                being Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and John Mayer.
